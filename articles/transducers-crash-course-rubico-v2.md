Transducers enable composable and memory efficient wrangling of very large or even infinite sets of data. With transducers, each item of the data is transformed by all operations in a single pass, as opposed to the data having to go through batch transformations one operation at a time.

The following example depicts numbers going through two batch transformations, one with `.filter` and one with `.map`.

```javascript [playground]
const isOdd = number => number % 2 == 1

const square = number => number ** 2

const manyNumbers = Array.from({ length: 1000 }, (_, i) => i)

console.log(
  manyNumbers
    .filter(isOdd)
    .map(square),
) // [1, 9, 25, 36, 49, ...]
```

<br />

With transducers, you could express the above transformation as a single pass. An item in the transformation would be both filtered and mapped before the next item in the reducing operation. Batch transformations must create an intermediate array between each operation; transducers do not have this requirement and so do not incur the memory penalty.

The next example takes the above example and converts it to use rubico transducers.

<br />

```javascript [playground]
const isOdd = number => number % 2 == 1

const square = number => number ** 2

const manyNumbers = Array.from({ length: 1000 }, (_, i) => i)

const squaredOdds = compose([
  Transducer.filter(isOdd),
  Transducer.map(square),
])

console.log(
  transform(manyNumbers, squaredOdds, [])
) // [1, 9, 25, 36, 49, ...]
```

Now the numbers are transformed in a single pass, avoiding the memory penalty ðŸŽ‰. Transducers offer many benefits and expressive power, but they can be confusing to anyone picking them up for the first time. I have found it easiest to build intuition for transducers by starting with reducers.

```coffeescript [specscript]
type Reducer = (
  accumulator any,
  value any,
)=>(nextAccumulator Promise|any)

type Transducer = Reducer=>Reducer
```

A `Reducer` is a function that defines a relationship between an accumulator and an item in a transformation, and can be used in a reducing operation, such as with [Array.prototype.reduce](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/reduce).

A `Transducer` is a function that takes a `Reducer` and returns another `Reducer`. Transducers enable function chains with reducers - pass a reducer to a transducer to create a reducer with chained functionality. Imagine dominos falling over.

It's a good exercise to try to implement transducers yourself. You could also use transducers through rubico. The `Transducer` module offers the core building blocks for rubico's transducer API.

 * [Transducer.map](/docs/Transducer.map)
 * [Transducer.filter](/docs/Transducer.filter)
 * [Transducer.flatMap](/docs/Transducer.flatMap)
 * [Transducer.forEach](/docs/Transducer.forEach)
 * [Transducer.passthrough](/docs/Transducer.passthrough)
 * [Transducer.tryCatch](/docs/Transducer.tryCatch)

A transducer must be used with a reducing implementation to have a transducing effect. This library provides async-capable implementations as `transform` and `reduce`, and it's also possible to execute a synchronous transducer with vanilla JavaScript `Array.prototype.reduce`.

The following example shows the function pipeline `squaredOdds` used as a transducer.

```javascript [playground]
const square = number => number ** 2

const isOdd = number => number % 2 == 1

const squaredOdds = compose([
  Transducer.filter(isOdd),
  Transducer.map(square),
])

const manyNumbers = Array.from({ length: 1000 }, (_, i) => i)

// consume the transducer squaredOdds with rubico's transform
console.log(
  transform(manyNumbers, squaredOdds, [])
) // [1, 9, 25, 36, 49, ...]

const arrayConcat = (array, value) => array.concat(value)

// consume the transducer squaredOdds with vanilla JavaScript
console.log(
  manyNumbers.reduce(squaredOdds(arrayConcat), []),
) // [1, 9, 25, 36, 49, ...]
```

With rubico's transducers, it is possible to transform asynchronous sources.

```javascript [playground]
const myAsyncSource = async function* () {
  let number = 0
  while (number < 1000) {
    yield number
    number += 1
  }
}

transform(myAsyncSource(), Transducer.passthrough, [])
  .then(console.log) // [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, ...]
```

This is powerful in comparison to the vanilla JavaScript `for await`, where it takes more lines to express the same operation.

```javascript [playground]
const myAsyncSource = async function* () {
  let number = 0
  while (number < 1000) {
    yield number
    number += 1
  }
}

setTimeout(async function () {
  const array = []
  for await (const number of myAsyncSource()) {
    array.push(number)
  }
  console.log(array) // [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, ...]
}, 0)
```

Transducers are useful for creating memory efficient data transformations, and are easy to use with rubico. You can get started with transducers at the [docs](/docs/Transducer.map).
